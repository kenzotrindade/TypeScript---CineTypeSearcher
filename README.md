## 📋 About The Project

This repository hosts **CineTypeSearcher**, a project developed as part of the **Coda** curriculum. The goal was to build a functional movie search tool while strictly adhering to **TypeScript** principles.

Unlike standard JavaScript projects, this application focuses on "Type Safety" to ensure that data fetched from movie APIs is correctly structured and handled throughout the code, reducing runtime errors.

> **Specific Goal:** Implementing a movie search interface that fetches real-time data while practicing advanced TypeScript interfaces and asynchronous programming.

## ⚙️ Key Concepts Mastered

Transitioning from JavaScript to TypeScript requires a change in mindset. This project demonstrates my understanding of:

* **🛡️ Static Typing:** Defining strict `interfaces` and `types` for movie objects (Title, Year, Director, etc.).
* **🌐 API Integration & Async/Await:** Handling asynchronous requests to movie databases while typing the JSON responses.
* **🔍 Generics & Utility Types:** Creating reusable logic to handle different types of search results and filterings.
* **🏗️ Error Handling:** Implementing robust error catching for failed API calls or missing data fields.
